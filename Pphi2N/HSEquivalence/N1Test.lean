# N=1 Hubbard-Stratonovich Test Case

Tests the HS transformation on the N=1 case (single scalar P(φ)₂).
The HS identity rewrites the φ⁴ interaction as a φ² coupling to an
auxiliary field σ, reducing the polynomial degree from 4 to 2.

## The equivalence

For N=1, φ : Λ → ℝ, u = φ², and the quartic λ(φ²-v²)² is a P(φ)₂
polynomial. The HS identity:

  exp(-λ(φ²-v²)²) = c ∫ dσ exp(-σ²/(4λ) + iσ(φ²-v²))

makes the φ-action quadratic: ½⟨φ,(-Δ+iσ)φ⟩. Integrating out φ
gives det(-Δ+iσ)^{-1/2}.

## What we prove

1. The HS identity is a Gaussian integral identity (exact)
2. The partition functions are equal: Z_{P(φ)₂} = Z_{HS}
3. The gap equation for N=1 matches the Wick mass renormalization

/-! ## The HS identity for N=1

This is the Fourier representation of the Gaussian. -/

/-! ## The gap equation for N=1

At N=1, the gap equation is:
  ½ G(x,x; m₀²) + 2λ(m₀² - v²) = 0

where G(x,x) is the Green's function diagonal (Wick constant).
This is exactly the Wick mass renormalization for P(φ)₂:

  m_phys² = m_bare² + (Wick counterterm from :P:)

The gap equation determines the physical mass from the bare parameters. -/

/-- The gap equation for N=1 on a finite lattice.
The saddle point σ* = m₀² satisfies:

  m₀² = v² - G(x,x; m₀²)/(4λ)

where G(x,x; m²) = (1/|Λ|) Σ_k 1/(eigenvalue_k + m²)
is the lattice Green's function diagonal. -/

/-! ## Connection to pphi2

The N=1 HS test establishes:
1. Z_{P(φ)₂} = Z_{HS} (exact, from the HS identity)
2. The gap equation matches the Wick renormalization
3. The σ-measure (pushforward of φ²) is well-defined

These connect the pphi2 construction (direct P(φ)₂) to the
pphi2N construction (HS auxiliary field). -/

/-- The N=1 interacting measure IS a P(φ)₂ measure.

For N=1, the O(N) interacting measure with P(t) = λ(t-v²)²
is exactly the P(φ)₂ interacting measure with the same
polynomial (after identifying Fin 1 → FinLatticeField with
FinLatticeField). -/
